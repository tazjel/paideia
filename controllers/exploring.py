Controller: Handle user-interactions for the game proper.

This controller handles everything from preparing the necessary session
variables before game activities begin to evaluating and recording the
student's performance. It does not cover any back-end actions or content
creation. Neither does it handle retrieval or display of student
statistics.

Terminology:

The basic metaphor for this educational game is that
of a character exploring a new town. Hence the name "exploring" for this
controller. That same metaphor is followed through in the naming of other
functions here and (especially) in the module paideia_exploring.

:path:
The game is built on a quest-like model, but each quest or task is called a
"path." This term does not refer in most cases to a file path but to a
discrete set of interactions that the student must perform in sequence. In
the rare case where a file path is intended this will be clear both from
context and in the docstring. A "path" is represented by the Path class in
the paideia_exploring module.

:step:
A path (i.e., quest or task) consists of several individual "steps." Each
"step" is a single user interaction involving
- a prompt (an npc question or other stimulus calling for user response),
- a user response (entered as form data, through a number of possible widgets)
- a reply (feedback presented to the user, along with the user's next
    navigation options)
A single step is represented by the Step class in the paideia_exploring module.
Some paths may include just a single step, while others may include a sequence
of several steps.

The base Step class involves a simple question prompt, calling for a text
response entered in a regular text input field. This class is extended by
several other classes, allowing for different kinds of user response. These
class names each begin with Step.

:walking:
Following the same metaphor, the movement through the steps of a path (and
from one path to the next) is referred to as a "walk." So the controller
function handling this movement is called walk() and the module includes a
Walk class that holds logic related to transitions from one step to the next.

These transitions are complicated because the steps in a path often have to be
completed in different locations around the fictional town of the game
setting. Since the user is free to move as they choose from one town location
to another, they may sometimes begin a second path in a new location before
moving on to the location where the original path can be completed.

Session variables:

The movement between steps and between paths is controlled by means of
several variables set on the web2py session object:
- session.tag_set (stores categorized grammatical tags for selecting paths;
    this information is calculated at the beginning of a new user session
    and then persists until the session expires.)
- session.active_paths (tracks the paths that are currently active, along with the
    last step that has been initiated for each one)
- session.completed (a cumulative list of the paths completed during the
    current user session)
- session.blocks (stores flags for any blocking conditions, checked just
    prior to each path and step selection)

Several other session variables provide data persistence across the various
states of a single step.
- session.location (reset to None whenever the user returns to town map)
- session.step (stores the Step instance initialized in the 'ask' state
    so that it can be reused to evaluate the user response; reset to None
    just before 'reply' view is presented to user)

Division of labour between controller and module:

Most of the business logic is referred to classes in the module
paideia_exploring. In a few cases it is a bit arbitrary whether to put
activity in the module or here in the controller functions. My basic
principles have been:
1. If in doubt, put it in the module (keep the controllers clean)
2. Keep all reading and writing to session variables in the controller (this
    is partly to minimize dependencies in the module classes, but also to
    avoid confusion about where and when the session is being modified.)
3. Keep db interaction in the controller if it is not too awkward. (This is
    mostly to minimize dependency in the classes and simplify unit testing.
    So far it hasn't seemed sensible to make it a hard rule, but more of the
    db interactions can probably be moved back to the controller.)
