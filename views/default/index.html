            <h3>Explore a first-century town</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='col-xs-8 index-contentbox'>
            <p>Paideia revolves around a fictional hellenized town in eastern Anatolia, on the fringe of the Roman Empire where it runs up against Parthian territory. You will take the role of a foreign slave, recently bought by a middle-class Jewish couple to serve in their house. From the start you are free to move around the town, visiting various locations by clicking them on the town map (there's always a link back to the map in the top menu).
            </p>

<div class='row'>
    <div class='container paragraphs'>
        <div class='col-xs-8 index-contentbox'>
            <p>In each location you may meet one of several townspeople who will
            ask you questions and give you jobs to do. Each interaction is
            called a "path" and you can track how many "paths" you have
            completed each day. Some paths will only involve one "step" (one
            interaction), while others will require you to go from one location
            to another and perform a few "steps" before you are done. Along the
            way, though, you will be introduced to more and more of the Greek
            language, using it to interact with the town's colourful population.

            <h3>Learn naturally</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='col-xs-8 index-contentbox'>
            <p>Paideia is meant to give you something a little like an
            immersion experience, so that you learn the language naturally, by
            using it. You will not be asked to do much memorizing of vocabulary
            lists or verb charts. At the same time, some structured
            understanding of the language can be a real help. So, whenever you
            start work on a new badge (learning a new facet of the language)
            you will be told that it is time to go and view a few sets of
            slides. These slides will sketch out the grammar, new vocabulary,
            and new word-forms that you are about to start using in your
            exchanges in the town. The point of these is not to spend a lot of
            time memorizing the details. Rather, the slides are a primer for
            the learning that will take place as you dive back into town life
            your conversations with the townspeople. If you ever start to feel
            lost, you can always click the "slides" link in the top menu and
            go back to view any of the slide sets again.

            <p>We all know that some of us pick up languages more quickly than
            others. Many people think they can't learn a language, just because
            they've never been able to learn at their own pace. In a
            traditional course, students are forced to match the instructor's
            pace. That means that some people feel from day one like they're
            being left behind, while other people get bored. Paideia is
            different. Each student is free to learn at his or her own pace.
            You don't have to keep up with anyone else, and you can take the
            time to really "get" one idea before you have to move on to the
            next.

            <h3>Mistakes are great</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='col-xs-8 index-contentbox'>
            <p>The biggest thing to realize about Paideia is that in this town there is no penalty for making mistakes. This is not a giant online test. So after every interaction you will be given examples of some proper responses you could have given. You can, if you like, immediately repeat the "step" and give one of the correct responses, or try out a different response. In fact, you will often learn the most by making mistakes and then looking at the correct responses to see where you went wrong. You are free to learn at your own pace. Once you are able to use your new knowledge without making mistakes, the townspeople will know you are ready to start learning something new.
