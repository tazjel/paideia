      '(beginner) is awarded when you start to learn a topic. It simply means '
      'that you are working on it. In your daily interactions in the town, the '
      'program will prioritize conversations tagged with these "beginner" badges '
      'since they are the ones you most need to review.'),
    P('At the other end of the scale, Level 4 (master) is awarded when you no '
      'longer need to learn anything more about that aspect of the language. '
      'You have shown that this knowledge is now in your long-term memory, and '
      'you are now on a permanent maintenance routine in which you only review '
      'that material once every six months. Don\'t be discouraged if you find '
      'that it takes a long time to reach "master" level for any badges. This '
      'doesn\'t mean you aren\'t progressing. It just means that you\'re still '
      'working on getting that topic into your long-term memory -- a process '
      'that can\'t be rushed.'),
    P('Between these two extremes, level 2 ("apprentice") and level 3 '
      '("journeyman") represent increasing levels of mastery over a particular '
      'element of Greek. You will review the material related to such badges '
      'less and less often as you continue to provide good responses when such '
      'conversations do come up. Normally, you will find that badges begun '
      'during a term will remain at levels 2 or 3 through at least the balance '
      'of that term. This doesn\'t mean anything is wrong. It just represents '
      'the fact that true mastery is a longer-term goal.'),

      'particular badge. (a) First, if you provide consistently right answers '

      'promoted to level 2. (b) Alternately, you will be promoted despite some '
      'errors if you have given at least 8 correct responses for each error over '
      'the last two weeks. In either case you won\'t be promoted until you have '
      'done at least 20 paths related to that badge, with at least 24 hours '
      'between the first success and the most recent success. Keep in mind that '
      'on a given day your paths will not all be focused on the same badges. '
      'So even if you provide good answers on 20 paths in a row, this may mean '
      'that you have only added 5 or 6 successes to your record for a particular '
      'badge. This is one advantage of doing extra paths regularly - you will '
      'progress more quickly because you are working on each of your level 1 '
      'badges more often.'),
    P('Levels 3 and 4 are reached as you go longer and longer without any '
      'errors in your responses on a given topic. If you make no errors with a '
      'badge over 7 days, it will be promoted to level 3. You are clearly '
      'retaining that knowledge and beginning toward real mastery. If you then '
      'go 30 days without any errors on that topic, the badge will be promoted '
      'to level 4 (mastered).'),

      'decide that you need to review your level 2, 3, or 4 badges. At that '
      'point, the badge will move to "level 1" in the "review level" column. '
      'This doesn\'t mean you have been demoted. It just means that the program '
      'is going to prioritize that badge as if it were brand new material. Even '
      'for badges that you have mastered, you will review those topics at least '
      'once every three months. If you give good responses to the review '
      'material, this review level will last only a day. The next day you will '
      'find the badge has returned to its normal review level and you will be '
      'much less likely to see those paths until the next review period is up.'),

      'previous badge level. But the program recognizes that you may need to '
      'review that material more frequently. So, instead of the badge jumping '
      'right back to its original review level, you will see it move up through '
      'the review levels as if you were earning it again. This just means that '
      'the program is making sure you see it often enough. If you don\'t make '
      'more mistakes, you will quickly find the badge\'s review level is back '
