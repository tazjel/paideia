Multiple steps: 63, 64
Name in prompt: 301, 70

## specific questions
Path 378 - συκα - gets lost if you leave the location, but requires going to map
Paths 265, 266 - also get lost if don't go directly


- rather than adding auth to current, auth is already on current.session (draw 
  from there.)
- remove "shadow" variable from module since 'impersonate' web2py func does 
  same
