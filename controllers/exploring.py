These controller functions handle user-interactions for the game proper. It
does not cover any back-end actions, content creation, or retrieval and
display of student performance statistics.

Wherever possible, business logic is kept out of these controllers and are
provided by classes in the module paideia_exploring. Controllers access
that logic through a very small set of public methods:

- Walk.next_step
- Walk.activate_step (for those cases in which
- Step.ask (accessed via the Step stored in the Walk object: Walk.step.ask)
- Step.process
(Walk._categorize_tags is also accessed externally from paideia_stats.py)

The controller functions interact with these views:
- exploring/index.html (frame for the game ui)
- exploring/walk.load (main game ui)
- exploring/patherror.load (error screen)
